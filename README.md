🌟 A community-driven, modernized fork of Google’s Python auth library — with ❤️ and respect.

This project is a respectful continuation of the official [`google-auth-library-python`](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python), focused on restoring full functionality, improving compatibility, and making it easier for developers to securely authenticate across Google Cloud and beyond.

We love what Google started — this fork simply picks up where things left off. No criticism. Just code.

---

## 🔧 Why this fork?

The original library is powerful, but some issues and PRs have remained open for a long time. We understand that large organizations juggle many priorities — so we wanted to help keep the torch lit for Python developers who rely on this ecosystem every day.

**`google-auth-rewired` exists to:**

- ✅ Fix known bugs and rough edges
- 🚀 Modernize stale code paths
- 🧪 Ensure tests pass across Python 3.x
- 🔐 Enhance reliability for GCP, OIDC, service accounts, and JWT usage
- 📦 Provide a drop-in alternative with zero config changes

---

## ✅ Features

- 100% backwards compatible with `google-auth`
- Cleaner test suite (passing on Python 3.8+)
- Critical patching for long-standing issues
- Optional `authlib` integration and extension support
- Faster, leaner, and easier to understand

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install google-auth-rewired
```

> Want to use it as a drop-in replacement?  
> You can alias it in your virtualenv or patch imports in your code. *(Docs coming soon!)*
