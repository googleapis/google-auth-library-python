      Use a service account (SA1) to impersonate as another service account (SA2) and obtain id token
      for the impersonated account.
      To obtain token for SA2, SA1 should have the "roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" permission
      on SA2.

    Args:
        impersonated_service_account: The name of the privilege-bearing service account for whom the credential is created.
            Examples: name@project.service.gserviceaccount.com

        scope: Provide the scopes that you might need to request to access Google APIs,
            depending on the level of access you need.
            For this example, we use the cloud-wide scope and use IAM to narrow the permissions.

        target_audience: The service name for which the id token is requested. Service name refers to the
            logical identifier of an API service, such as "iap.googleapis.com".
