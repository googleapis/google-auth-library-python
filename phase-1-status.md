# âœ… Phase 1 Status â€” Completed

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a testable, mock-friendly implementation of `IdentityPoolCredentials` that passes the complete suite in `tests/test_identity_pool.py` (I1â€“I9) with full header, param, and token coverage.

---

## âœ… What Was Completed

- Implemented `IdentityPoolCredentials.refresh()` with:
  - `.token` and `.expiry` assignment
  - Env var injection
  - Header and query param logic
- Passed all 20 tests in `tests/test_identity_pool.py`
- Added:
  - `requirements.txt` (test and lint dependencies)
  - `pytest.ini` (isolates test discovery to Phase 1)
  - `run_tests.ps1` for Windows
  - `run_tests.sh` for Linux/macOS
- Finalized `README.md` with Phase 1 scope, test instructions, and Linux support
- CI runs clean via GitHub Actions
